# Read and Count

There are some JSON files in the `home/labex/json_files` folder, all the keys are string objects.

Try to read them all and count how many elements are in them by the Python script `count.py`

For example, there are three elements in the above JSON data structure:

```json
{
  "1": [1, 2],
  "2": "abc",
  "3": { "a": "b" }
}
```

## Requirements

- The path of `count.py` is `/home/labex/project`.
- The count result should be `print` in the console.
