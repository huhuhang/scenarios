# Fibonacci Generator

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will be working with two important concepts in Python - Iterators and Generators. Iterators are objects that can be iterated (looped) upon, and generators are a simple way to create new iterators. By the end of this challenge, you will have a solid understanding of these two important concepts and how to use them in Python.
