# Words Line Up in Order

What is the first word in each file? And the second? And the third?

Try to put the n-th word to one file `output/n` by Python

For example:

```python
# output/1, start count with 1.
CentOS Java A Python Ubuntu
```

```python
# output/100, the 100-th file, only java and program have 100-th word.
code being
```

## Requirements

- The path of the `output` folder is `/home/labex/project/`
- Word order in each file is not considered.
- Punctuations are not words.
